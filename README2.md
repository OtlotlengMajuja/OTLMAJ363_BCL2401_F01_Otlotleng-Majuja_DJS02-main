# DJS02 Project Brief: Whole Number Divider

## Introduction

In this project, I ad to use user stories in the form of the Gherkin syntax to create a simple JavaScript program that performs a division operation and validates user inputs to provide an error-free experience.

#### Project Overview

The existing codebase for the Whole Number Divider meets certain user stories but falls short on others. My task is to modify and extend the code to address all specified user stories, ensuring a robust, user-friendly application.

## Elements Included

**Form Handling:** The code captures user inputs from the form (dividend and divider) using event listeners and extracts the values using FormData and object destructuring.
**Error Handling:** The application validates the inputs for possible errors, such as invalid numbers or division by zero, to display appropriate error messages and handle critical errors by showing a "critical-error" message.
**DOM Manipulation:** The script dynamically updates the HTML content using methods like innerText to display results and error messages.

## Reflections

### Areas of Mastery

**Event Listeners:** I gained proficiency in handling form submissions and preventing the default behavior to perform custom actions.
**Error Handling:** My experience in managing various error scenarios (empty inputs, division by zero, invalid numbers, and critical errors) improved my ability to provide meaningful feedback to users.
**Regular Expressions:** This project allowed me to explore the use of regular expressions to detect non-numeric characters in user inputs.

## Challenges Faced

One difficulty was ensuring comprehensive input validation, including number parsing, string validation, and division by zero checks. Another was implementing logic to detect critical errors without interfering with the regular input validation was another challenging aspect of the project.

## Overall Learning Experience

I believe I improved my ability to handle various types of errors and provide helpful error messages, which contributes to a better user experience. Also to adapt to challenges like input validation and critical error detection, fostering flexibility, and how to apply JavaScript concepts in a real-world scenario.
